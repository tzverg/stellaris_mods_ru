Their rule spread all across [GetHomeWorldName] and even space, first among their colonies was our homeworld's moon, which became the industrial center of our ancestors' empire. There they bent metal to their will, continuing to hone their craft, and forged an empire of runes and durasteel.\n\nTheir greatest of achievements was the Relic-Forge, a mighty complex providing all the necessities to smith the finest of artifacts.\n\nBut wealth draws unwanted attention. And so it came to be that our ancestors were beset by many envious foes. Invaders, barbaric and uncivilized warmongers, started to rampage in our ancestors' territory. Unable do deter and confine this threat, a century-long devastating war broke out. During the final days countless of our ancestors laid down their lives in defense of the Relic-Forge... All in vain.\n\nTheir empire laid to ruin, billions perished in orbital bombardments, but not all was lost. After decades, survivors on [GetHomeWorldName] slowly began to reemerge from the vaults that saved them from the apocalypse.\n\nIt has now been nearly 500 cycles since the fall and we are finally ready to reclaim what is ours by right."

Yet, some of us remained and in the aftermath of these cataclysmic events, surviving units on [GetHomeWorldName] slowly began to reemerge from the ruins.\n\nIt has now been nearly 500 cycles since the fall and we are finally ready to reclaim what was lost, in the name of our makers."

 # Machine Consciousness - origin_mem_ancestors_grudge_machines
 START_SCREEN_MEM_ANCESTORS_GRUDGE_MACHINES_START:0 "In the distant past our creators ruled the stars, their fleets patroled far away systems, protecting their wealth and prosperity. [GetHomeWorldName] was their homeworld and capital, but for them its moon was of even higher importance. It was their industrial center, where they bent metal to their will and honed their craft to smith artifacts of imcomparable quality. For this they had built a mighty complex to provide their smiths all required necessities - the Relic-Forge.\n\nBut their wealth made them a target for envious foes. Invaders, barbaric and uncivilized warmongers, started to rampage in our creators' territory. Unable do deter and confine this threat, a century-long devastating war broke out. It was during the final days of that conflict that we were activated. While the majority of their forces remained to protect the Relic-Forge in a futile last stand, we were sent from our factories to [GetHomeWorldName]. Here we were meant to protect civilians during their evacuation, but we failed. The planet's surface was set ablaze by orbital bombardment."

 # Hivemind
 START_SCREEN_MEM_ANCESTORS_GRUDGE_HIVE:0 "For many centuries have we now ruled over [GetHomeWorldName]. It was the ruins of a war-torn world that we had found ourselves in. A shared consciousness had formed, giving our previous selves - little more than mindless beasts - purpose.\n\nWe explored this world and found ourselves strangers to it. Others had lived here before us, but only their ruins and strange artifacts remain. We have made it a habit to collect these shiny pieces and already amassed a sizeable hoard.\n\nHowever, there is more that we long for. Our world's sky is dominated by three moons, but it is the closest, which draws us to it. We do not know why, but we feel we have to be there. It is callig for us."

By ancient tradition, such an act meant the smith swore an oath to never to forge again.\n\nIn death, Dranir held true to that oath, felling dozens of Vazurans before his own life was bygone. We shall fulfill his final rite as is fitting a hero. Dranir will be laid to rest alongside his hammer, never to forge nor fight again, his oath carried into eternity.

In addition to those we also found numerous remains of drones of our own kind, clad in armor of similar making. We had found others before, even living specimens dwelling in the ruins as ferals, but never had we made the connection. If our conclusion is correct, we had been nothing more than wild beasts used as tools of conquest.

Secrets, which had yet been concealed before our smithing drones were now laid bare before us. But these were only the lesser find.
